Read the full debate transcript (all rounds, all agents).

Produce TWO JSON objects in sequence, separated by a blank line:

1) CONSENSUS SCENARIO — majority positions with directional and sector magnitude estimates
2) MINORITY DISSENT — positions that were overruled but represent tail risk

Also include:
- plausibility_score: 0-100 based on historical analogue match, internal consistency, and economic logic
- primary_transmission_channels: list of agreed channels
- preserved_dissent_summary: one paragraph on what the minority warned about

Score plausibility honestly. If the debate was weak or contradictory, say so.

Output valid JSON only for each object. No markdown fences."""
